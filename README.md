# 🧩 CSES Problem Set Solutions

Welcome to my repository of **CSES Problem Set** solutions!
This repo contains my implementations for various **competitive programming** problems from [cses.fi](https://cses.fi/problemset/).
All solutions are written with a focus on **clean code**, **efficiency**, and **readability**.

## 📚 About the CSES Problem Set

The [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) is a collection of high-quality competitive programming problems that cover topics like:

* Introductory Problems
* Sorting and Searching
* Dynamic Programming
* Graph Algorithms
* Range Queries
* Tree Algorithms
* Mathematics
* Geometry
* Advanced Techniques

---

## ⚙️ Languages Used

* **C++23** (primary)

---

## 🧠 Approach

Each problem is solved with:

* Clear logic and structured implementation
* Use of standard algorithms and STL features
* Optimized time and space complexity
